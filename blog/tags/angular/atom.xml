    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Configuration blocks and run blocks get executed at different points in the application bootstrap, and have different injection locals at their disposal. Hereâ€™s a summary of what you can find in the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module">AngularJS documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Configuration blocks (registered with <code>module.config()</code>) get executed during provider registration, and can only be injected providers and constants (see <code>module.provider()</code> and <code>module.constant()</code>). This is typically where you would configure application-wide stuff, such as the $routeProvider. Stuff that needs to be configured before the services are created.</p>

<p>Run blocks (registered with <code>module.run()</code>) get executed after the injector has all the providers. Now, all instances and constants can be injected. This is typically where you would configure services, <code>$rootScope</code>, events and so on.</p>

<p>You can have multiple of either, and they are executed in the order they were registered to the module. Some people prefer to register a configuration block before every group of controllers to register the routes to these controller, for example.</p>
